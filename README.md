# KenKenPuzzle
Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP): 
1. Implemented constraint propagators (Forward Checking and Generalized Arc Consistence) and ordering heuristics of varaible and value (Minimum-Remaining-Value, Degree, and Least-Constraining-Value) in Python
2. Applied CSP propagators and ordering heuristics to solve KenKen Puzzle that has "cage" constraints
